### Brief description üë§

I am a software engineer student, I have experience in fullstack webdev and I am interested in Transhumanism.

I love all the topics related to CS, CE and Sci-Fi, I've been coding for approximately 4 years by now. I am still looking for a specific branch to specialize in. Linux (POP_OS) is my main and favorite OS, have been using it for over 2 years for personal, professional and academical purposes.
